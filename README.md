## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1. The **latest version of Python** installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. A **Discord account** with access to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create and manage your bot.
3. The necessary permissions in your Discord server to create channels, manage roles, and configure settings.
4. Make sure that you have the permission roles that are below you also. (i.e. If you're the owner, you still need the designated Admin and Mod roles)
5. Role Hierarchy: Everyone (Power Level 0), Mod (Power Level 1), Admin (Power Level 2), and Servicer (Power Level 3)

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Doesn't Respond to Commands
- Make sure the bot has the correct permissions in your Discord server.
- Ensure the bot is online and running in the terminal.
- Double-check the command prefix (default: `!`).
- Make sure your role has permission to use the command.

### Modmail System Isn’t Working
- Ensure the modmail category exists and matches the `MODMAIL_CATEGORY_ID` in `config.json`.
- The bot must have permission to create channels.

### Logging Issues
If text or image logs are not working, check:
- That `TEXT_LOG_CHANNEL_ID` and `IMAGE_LOG_CHANNEL_ID` are not set to `0` if logging is required.
- The bot has permission to send messages in the logging channels.

### Other Errors
- If you see errors in the terminal, restart the bot and check `logs.txt` for details.
- If problems persist, contact **GhostHasGone** on Discord.
